Hi, Gray00 here (aka graylan0 aka Graylan aka freedomdao) 

I'm giving credit to Matthew and Xphoenix for making a great piece of code and actually working with the robot (through me) to get better code.


You can find their original repo here.
(i helped them with a code jam with Dave as the main engineer) (this allowed dave critical training).

2023 vechicles, Airgapped.

I dub this, true Web3. 

Not blockchain.


Blockchain is 2.9 (and we can use blockchain with these systems well)

Blockchain + Simulation internet = Web3.


We deploy.

Live.

Another huge shoutout to techcoderx(my partner), buzzmoo, security_live, vaultec, blaiselabs.


Lastly. Recently Kevin Mitnick passed away. I have to say. Without Kevin #hackerdao may have never formed and this reality would only exist in other multiverses.

Thank you Kevin; Rest Easy <3
