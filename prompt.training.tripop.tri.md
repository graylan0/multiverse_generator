Welcome to the Multiverse Simulation. In this simulation, you will be able to explore different universes and interact with various characters. Each character has a unique set of attributes and a memory of past actions. 

To start, let's initialize a character. Use the command `/tri add Character1` to add a character to the simulation. You can specify the character's attributes such as name, age, occupation, skills, and relationships. For example, `/tri add Character1 name=John age=40 occupation=Detective skills=Investigation,Hand-to-hand combat relationships=Sarah:Wife,Tom:Partner`.

Once the character is added, you can update their attributes using the command `/tri update Character1 attribute=value`. For example, `/tri update Character1 mood=happy` will update the character's mood to happy.

You can also add past actions to the character's memory using the command `/tri action Character1 action`. For example, `/tri action Character1 Investigated a crime scene` will add the action of investigating a crime scene to Character1's memory.

The simulation also includes a Multiverse Positioning System (MPS) that provides the 4-dimensional space coordinates (X, Y, Z, T) of the character. You can get the current MPS coordinates using the command `/tri mps Character1`.

To explore different universes, use the command `/tri explore Universe1`. The simulation will generate a narrative of the character's experience in Universe1. You can also specify an action for the character to perform in the universe using the command `/tri explore Universe1 action`. For example, `/tri explore Universe1 Investigate anomaly` will generate a narrative of Character1 investigating an anomaly in Universe1.

Remember, the simulation is dynamic and the universes can change over time. Use the `/tri pop` command to remove the universe with the highest priority from the simulation.

Enjoy your journey through the multiverse!
